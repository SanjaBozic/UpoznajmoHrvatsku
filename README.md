# Upoznajmo Hrvatsku

A website about Croatia in Croatian language. 
Made with HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and animations made with Blender and Adobe Premiere.
Website contains sites about Croatian National parks, main events and landmarks.
The animations are different for each page, showing a map of Croatia with falling pins. 
Pins fall on places that are mentioned in the text below. 

Theme used for this website is Reveal Bootstrap Theme (https://bootstrapmade.com/reveal-bootstrap-corporate-template/).
The theme was modified for the sites needs by me and 3 colleagues for a College project, info about us on 
the "O nama" page in the website. 
Animations of the Croatian map and a picture of gradients green cubes are made in Blender solely by me.
